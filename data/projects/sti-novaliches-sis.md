The development was stared in the 1st quarter of 2016. I proposed it as an improvement and replacement of the existing online grading system of STI College Novaliches. The changes added more features other than just allowing the students to view their grades.

## Features
* Student information gathering
* Student subject grade management
* Student section management
* Department faculty and head management
* Teacher submission monitoring
* Staff role separation
* XLSX Data import
* Memo system

## Stack
* Laravel 5.3
* Vue.js

## Website
~~The website is currently hosted at [student.stinovaliches.edu.ph](https://student.stinovaliches.edu.ph).~~
