Vianderito is an online platform that eliminates the need of a cashier to checkout in a grocery or a convenience store. It also eliminates the need of scanning an item one-by-one with a barcode scanner by using RFID stickers and long-range RFID scanner.

The store management system is built on top of web technologies and the customer mobile application is built as an Android application.
