# Storytime

Ever since I&lsquo;ve been a tinkerer. I like knowing how things work. I&lsquo;ve always interested in how the world works and how it is powered by technology.

I started coding when I was 11 years old. I always wanted to build something to be used by other people. It is my encouragement for learning and building stuffs, that people can benefit from my works.

From there, I&lsquo;ve worked with different projects, sometimes alone, sometimes with other people and volunteered to do websites and systems for the purpose of learning. I learn by doing actual things.

I put the label **Full-Stack Developer** under my name, having the knowledge and experience I gained doing different projects.
