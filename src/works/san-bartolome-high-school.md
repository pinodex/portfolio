This website is the most that I am proud of. It started as a class project for my 3rd year high school ICT subject. It was also my first website to use a framework: [rwarasaurus/nano](https://github.com/rwarasaurus/nano). That served as my foundation to learn other frameworks out there.

The website remained on my playground until I was in 4th year high school where I got the opportunity to propose it in our journalism class.

After the proposal, I learned about **Silex PHP** and **Zurb Foundation** and decided to rewrite the website with them to provide more flexibility in development.

I was so happy that it was supported by our school principal, and made it the official website of San Bartolome High School.

The website featured a blog-like interface where writers can write posts and announcements.

The website also featured a gallery page where the school events pictures are posted.

It remained active until the first quarter of 2017 when the school principal moved to another school.
